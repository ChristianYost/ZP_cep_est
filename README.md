# Differential Cepstrum Zero/Pole Extraction  
This is a python implementation of a new technique for extracting the zeros and poles of a system. As input we take an impulse response. From this we calculate its differential cepstrum and fit it using Prony's Method.  
  
`prony_cep.py` demonstrates this on analytic signals.  
`real_signal.py` demonstrates this on real signals.  
`cepstrum_utils.py` has all of the necessary functions.  
  
## Analytic Example
